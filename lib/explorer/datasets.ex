  Datasets used in examples and exploration.

  Note those datasets are not available inside Elixir releases
  (see `mix release`), which is the usual way to deploy Elixir
  in production. Therefore, if you need one of those datasets
  in production, you must download the source files to your
  own application `priv` directory and load them yourself.
  For example:

      Explorer.DataFrame.from_csv!(Application.app_dir(:my_app, "priv/iris.csv"))

  Wine Dataset.

  The data is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same
  region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis
  determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three
  types of wines.

  Iris Dataset.

  This classic dataset was collected by Edgar Anderson in 1936
  and made famous by R. A. Fisher's 1936 paper. It consists of
  several measurements of three species of Iris (Iris setosa,
  Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
